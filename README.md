# âœ¨ CSS Animation | Bringing Web Elements to Life! âœ¨

CSS Animation allows developers to add motion and interactivity to web elements â€” without using JavaScript. With just CSS, we can create smooth transitions, eye-catching movements, and engaging user experiences.

## ðŸŽ¬ About This Project
In this project, I explored the core concepts of CSS animations and created a fully animated scene, including:
- âœ… Moving vehicles with rotating wheels  
- âœ… Flying birds and floating clouds  
- âœ… A running boy and a playful dog  

## ðŸ’¡ Key CSS Animation Techniques Used:
- ðŸŽ¯ `@keyframes` for defining motion sequences  
- ðŸŽ¯ `animation` properties for timing, repetition, and linear effects  
- ðŸŽ¯ Positioning elements with `absolute` and `relative` for dynamic layouts  
- ðŸŽ¯ `z-index` for proper layering and depth effect  

## ðŸš€ Why CSS Animations?
CSS Animations help make websites more interactive, engaging, and user-friendly, enhancing the overall user experience. They also improve storytelling on the web â€” whether it's moving objects, interactive buttons, or dynamic scenes like this one!
